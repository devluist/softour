This was a project for college. I was in charge of the Backend, Architecture and Frontend of the Admin Dashboard and the scripts to hanlde map (OSM) on the client side.


The app was a Venue discovery site based on restaurants, accommodations, transport and places for the Sucre state, Venezuela but with an open architecture to allow it to grow to cover more places.

Users could register, comment, add to favorite, multilanguage, Admin Dashboard and rate places/venues.

This was implemented with:

- mongoDB
- Nodejs 8.10

I learned
- Deeply the nodejs/express ecosystem
- mongodb/mongoose
- Design patterns (I implemented Factory for POI creation since they have similar structure and for the User class, and also the Strategy Pattern based on Passport.js), 
- Classes syntax for javascript (by that time it was cool)
